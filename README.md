## Instructions for Running the Notebook

Welcome! This notebook contains code that must be executed in a specific order to function properly. To ensure smooth execution and avoid any errors, please follow these guidelines:

## How to Run the Notebook

**Open the notebook file (.ipynb) in your Jupyter Notebook environment.**

### Run Cells Sequentially:

**Start by running the first cell at the top.**

**Progress down the notebook cell by cell, executing each cell one after the other.**

### Avoid Skipping Cells:

**Do not skip any cells, as the notebook may depend on variables, data, or code defined earlier.**

**Skipping cells can result in errors or incomplete execution.**
